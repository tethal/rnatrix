# Project Roadmap

See [[README]] for project overview and design decisions.

## Phase 1: Tree-Walking Interpreter

**Goal:** Build a working interpreter that directly evaluates AST nodes from script files

### Infrastructure
- [ ] Project structure setup - libs with compiler/interpreter, CLI exe
- [ ] Framework for golden file based testing

### Language Features
- [ ] Basic expressions (arithmetic, comparison, logical)
- [ ] Variables and assignment (`let x = 5`)
- [ ] Functions (definition and calls)
- [ ] Control flow (if/else, while loops)
- [ ] Dynamic typing only
- [ ] Run from script files

### Rust Learning Focus
- Enums for AST representation
- Pattern matching for evaluation
- `Rc<RefCell<>>` for environments/scopes
- Basic error handling
- Ownership and borrowing with tree structures

### Deliverables
- Lexer/Tokenizer
- Parser (recursive descent)
- AST definitions
- Tree-walking evaluator
- Test suite with example programs

### GC Strategy
Just `Rc<>`, accept memory leaks from cycles

## Phase 2: Bytecode VM

**Goal:** Compile to bytecode and execute on a stack-based virtual machine

### New Features
- [ ] Bytecode instruction set design
- [ ] Compiler (AST â†’ bytecode)
- [ ] Stack-based VM
- [ ] Better performance than tree-walking

### Rust Learning Focus
- Vectors as stacks
- Instruction encoding
- First `unsafe` code for performance
- More sophisticated enum usage
- Debugging bytecode execution

### Deliverables
- Bytecode instruction definitions
- Bytecode compiler
- VM with stack and instruction pointer
- Disassembler for debugging
- Performance comparison with Phase 1

### GC Strategy
Upgrade to `Rc<RefCell<>>` with better reference management

---

## Phase 3: Type Annotations & Checking

**Goal:** Add optional static types and type checker

### New Features
- [ ] Type annotation syntax (`:` syntax like `x: int`)
- [ ] Type checker as separate pass
- [ ] Type inference for simple cases
- [ ] Typed function signatures
#### Ideas to be discussed
- [ ] Primitive types: `int`, `float`, `bool`, `string`
- [ ] Function types: `fn(T1, T2) -> R`
- [ ] Simple collection types: `array<T>`

### Rust Learning Focus
- Complex AST traversal algorithms
- Symbol tables with proper lifetimes
- Type representation and unification
- Multi-pass compilation

### Deliverables
- Extended AST with type annotations
- Type checker implementation
- Type error messages
- Examples of gradually-typed programs
- Optimizations for statically-typed code paths

### Note
Keep it simple - no generics, no variance, no structural subtyping yet. Start with invariant generics only.

---

## Phase 4: x64 Code Generation

**Goal:** Compile fully-typed functions to native x64 machine code

### New Features
- [ ] JIT or AOT compilation to x64
- [ ] Only compile statically-typed functions
- [ ] Fall back to interpreter/VM for dynamic code
- [ ] FFI for calling compiled code
- [ ] Real garbage collector

### Rust Learning Focus
- Heavy `unsafe` code
- FFI and C interop
- Raw pointers and memory layout
- Working with assembler libraries

### Deliverables
- Code generator
- Runtime support for compiled code
- Proper GC (mark-sweep or mark-compact)
- Benchmarks comparing interpreted vs compiled

### GC Strategy
Implement or integrate real tracing GC - required for native code

### Tools to Consider
- `cranelift-jit` - production-quality code generator
- `dynasm-rs` - runtime assembler
- `rust-gc` - existing GC implementation
- Custom mark-sweep collector (better for learning)

---

## Phase 5: Advanced Types (Optional)

**Goal:** Add sophisticated type system features

### New Features
- [ ] Generic functions and types
- [ ] Traits/interfaces
- [ ] Better type inference (Hindley-Milner)
- [ ] Variance annotations
- [ ] Structural typing for objects/records

### Rust Learning Focus
- Advanced type system algorithms
- Unification and constraint solving
- Generic programming patterns in Rust

### Note
This phase is genuinely hard PL theory. Consider it a stretch goal.

---

## Milestones

### Milestone 1: "Hello, World"
Can run basic programs with functions and variables

### Milestone 2: "Fibonacci"
Can compute recursive functions efficiently via bytecode

### Milestone 3: "Typed Fibonacci"
Can type-check and optimize statically-typed recursive functions

### Milestone 4: "Native Fibonacci"
Can compile to x64 and run at native speed

---

## Future Possibilities

After Phase 5, could explore:
- Concurrency primitives
- Module system
- Standard library
- Package manager
- Language server protocol (IDE support)
- Self-hosting (compiler written in itself)

Don't think about these until much later!
